# Canada
This is a Chrome plug-in that modifies many online shopping sites to indicte goods that have US, Mexican, or Canadian origins, including goods with a mixture (i.e. a US company but made in Canada).
Canadian only: üçÅ
Mexican only:  üá≤üáΩ
United States: ‚ùå
Mixed US/Canada:‚ùì
Mixed Mexico/Canada:‚ùî
Not from any of those 3 nations: üåê

The reason for including Mexico as a separate country rather than "rest of the world" is that Mexico has also been attacked by the United States. As they say, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

Steps for installation:
(1) Download the files to a folder, or download them as a zip file and decompress them into a folder.
(2) [optional] modify the background.js file to add or remove products from the US or Canadian lists
(3) Go to chrome://extensions/ in the address bar
(4) Click "load unpacked" in the upper left.
(5) Navigate to the folder and select the folder.
(6) That's it. Just make sure the extension is enabled.
(7) Please check for yourself. I needed to rush to get this done quickly, so fork the project if you wish and change the list, etc.

This is a response to Trump's tariffs against Canada. But once we're doing it, why not buy keep buying Canadian even once the economic attack on Canada is over?

The list of products was created using a variety of databases, AI inquiries, and personal research. DO NOT ASSUME IT IS ACCURATE. 
Some products, like Kirkland brand or Kraft, are US companies but do a lot of their manufacturing in Canada, which show up with "‚ùì", but the matching logic is fairly complex, so there will be errors.

If somebody is able to integrate this with a database of some kind, please do it.

I would love for this to be more accurate.

Should work on any site (should, not will for sure). Feel free to modify it to work on other sites. The whole idea is to
make it easier for people shopping online to quickly identify and select the Canadian product.

Canada needs to diversity its trading partners. It can never again let itself be vulnerable to a devastating economic attack by any single country -- 
no matter how longstanding the alliance with that country has been. Once your neighbor has set fire to your house once,
you need to take steps to prevent it from happening again.
