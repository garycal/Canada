This is a response to Trump's tariffs against Canada. But once we're doing it, why not buy keep buying Canadian even once the economic attack on Canada is over?

The list of products was created using a variety of databases, AI inquiries, and personal research. DO NOT ASSUME IT IS ACCURATE. 
Some products, like Kirkland brand or Kraft, are US companies but do a lot of their manufacturing in Canada. So even though they show up with an "‚ùå", 
they may actually be made in Canada and ok to buy. If somebody is able to integrate this with a database of some kind, please do it.
I would love for this to be more accurate.
